          <p>TAAL BASILICA, BATANGAS: Asia’s Largest Catholic Church
            A giant scaffolding rose right before the basilica’s altar at the point where the nave and the transept meet. Apparently, the church’s interiors were undergoing a minor renovation. The top of the bamboo scaffold reached to the ceiling of the dome which was being painted. I could not imagine how difficult it was for the painters. After all, they were inside the biggest Catholic church in the Philippines and in the whole of Asia.</p>
